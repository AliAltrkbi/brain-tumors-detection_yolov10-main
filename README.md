** Brain Tumor Detection using YOLOv10**

This project implements a brain tumor detection model using YOLOv10 for detecting tumors in medical images. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a real-time object detection system, and version 10 is an advanced variation that improves on accuracy and speed.

 Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure the following dependencies are installed:

1. **Python 3.7+**
2. **Required Libraries**:
   - `ultralytics` (YOLOv10)
   - `numpy`
   - `matplotlib`
   - `opencv-python`

You can install the necessary dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/THU-MIG/yolov10.git numpy matplotlib opencv-python
```

 Steps to Run the Project

 1. Set Up the Project Environment

Make sure your environment is properly set up with the required libraries. You can use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:


python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # For Windows: env\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt  # If you have a requirements file
```

 2. Install YOLOv10

The project uses the YOLOv10 repository from GitHub. You can install it directly from the notebook using the following command:

```bash
!pip install -q git+https://github.com/THU-MIG/yolov10.git
```

Alternatively, you can run this command in your local environment.

 3. Load the Dataset

Ensure that you have a dataset of brain tumor images. You may use any medical imaging dataset for this purpose, such as MRI scans. You need to place the dataset in an accessible path or load it directly from your preferred data source.

 4. Run the Notebook

To run the brain tumor detection code, simply launch the Jupyter Notebook:



Then open the `brain-tumors-detection_yolov10-main.ipynb` notebook.

5. Execution Flow

1. **Install YOLOv10**:
   The notebook installs YOLOv10 directly from the GitHub repository:
   

   !pip install -q git+https://github.com/THU-MIG/yolov10.git


2. **Load and Preprocess the Data**:
   Load the images of brain scans, preprocess them (such as resizing or normalizing), and prepare them for input into the YOLOv10 model.

3. **Model Inference**:
   Use the YOLOv10 model for detecting brain tumors in the input images. The model will generate bounding boxes around the detected tumors.

4. **Visualization**:
   Visualize the detection results using `matplotlib` or `opencv-python` to display the images with the detected tumor regions highlighted.

6. Customize the Model

You can modify the model architecture or the detection thresholds by adjusting the parameters of YOLOv10 as required for better performance on your specific dataset.
